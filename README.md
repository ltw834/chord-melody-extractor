## 🏗️ Architecture

ChordSnap uses a modern, modular architecture:

### Frontend Stack
- **Next.js 14** with App Router
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Radix UI** for accessible components
- **Zustand** for state management

### Audio Processing
- **Web Audio API** for real-time microphone input
- **Web Workers** for background audio analysis
- **FFT + Chroma extraction** for pitch content analysis
- **Template matching** with machine learning classification
- **Viterbi decoding** for temporal chord smoothing

### Core Components

## 🎵 How It Works

### Audio Processing Pipeline

1. **Audio Input** - Capture from microphone or decode uploaded files
2. **Frame Extraction** - Split audio into overlapping analysis windows (2048-4096 samples)
3. **FFT Analysis** - Convert time-domain audio to frequency spectrum
4. **Chroma Extraction** - Map frequencies to 12-tone pitch classes (C, C#, D, ..., B)
5. **Chord Matching** - Compare chroma vectors against chord templates using cosine similarity
6. **Temporal Smoothing** - Apply median filtering and Viterbi decoding to reduce noise
7. **Context Integration** - Use detected key and musical context to improve accuracy

### Chord Detection Algorithm

```typescript
// Simplified chord detection flow
const chroma = extractChroma(audioFrame, sampleRate);
const keyPrior = detectKey(chromaHistory);
const chordMatch = matchChordToChroma(chroma, vocabularyLevel, keyPrior);
const smoothedChord = smoothingFilter.addObservation(chordMatch);
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Audio Settings

- **Vocabulary Level**: `basic` | `extended` | `rich`
- **Smoothing Strength**: 0.0 (responsive) to 1.0 (stable)
- **Update Rate**: 10-50 Hz
- **Tuning Offset**: ±50 cents
- **Capo Offset**: 0-12 frets

### Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` for optional configuration:

```bash
# Optional analytics (privacy-focused)
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS=off

# Custom audio processing settings
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_FRAME_SIZE=4096
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_HOP_SIZE=1024
```

## 📱 PWA Installation

ChordSnap works as a Progressive Web App:

1. **Mobile**: Visit the site and tap "Add to Home Screen"
2. **Desktop**: Look for the install prompt in your browser's address bar
3. **Manual**: Browser menu → "Install ChordSnap" or "Add to Home Screen"

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Test chord template matching
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern=templates

# Test audio processing
pnpm test -- --testPathPattern=audio
```

## Optional: Omnizart (advanced transcription)

That’s an excellent idea — Omnizart is a powerful Python toolbox that adds note-level transcription, multi-instrument support, drum, vocal melody, beat, and chord detection — well beyond what Whisper or your current audio pipeline offers.

What Omnizart brings

- Pre-trained models for chord recognition, as well as note-level melodic transcription, beat/downbeat, drum events, and vocal pitch.
- Command-line tools (omnizart chord transcribe <file.wav>) and a Python API make it flexible to both batch and code-driven pipelines.
- Based on deep learning research from MCT Lab, it’s suitable for polyphonic music transcription.

How to integrate Omnizart into your app

1. Add it as an optional backend method:

```py
try:
    import omnizart
    HAVE_OMNIZART = True
except ImportError:
    HAVE_OMNIZART = False
```

2. Add a checkbox in your UI: “Use Omnizart (advanced)” and pass `use_omnizart=true` in your processing request payload.

3. In your server-side processing endpoint, prefer Omnizart when requested and available:

```py
if mode == 'both':
    if use_omnizart and HAVE_OMNIZART:
        path = ensure_wav(src)
        from omnizart.app import chord
        result = chord.transcribe(path)
        bars = [(seg['start'], seg['label']) for seg in result['chords']]
        key_name = 'Unknown'
    else:
        tempo, _, _, key_name, bars = analyze_chords(path)
        bars = diatonic_simplify(bars, key_name)
```

4. Installation instructions (optional):

```bash
pip install omnizart
omnizart download-checkpoints
```

Note: Omnizart requires Linux or x86 Mac (ARM builds currently unsupported). See their GitHub issues if you’re on M1/M2 Mac.

Recommendation: Safe-by-default

- Keep your current chord method for consistency and wider compatibility.
- If Omnizart is installed, expose an opt-in checkbox to users.
- Always provide a fallback so ARM Macs and environments without extra dependencies continue to work.

If you want, I can generate the exact code diff to add Omnizart support in your backend and create the UI toggle snippet for your React page.
